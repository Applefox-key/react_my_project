        The simple and effective strategy of "the 90 second method"
      </h1>

      <p>
        When you see a new word, you should write it down in your notes. But not
        just the word by itself. Give it some context. For example, don't just
        write the translation of depend. It's better to write down the phrase
        you saw or heard the word in. For example, it entirely depends on you.
        This way, you will get a ton of useful details (prepositions, articles,
        word order, and so on), and most importantly, you will be able to say
        the phrase when you need it. The word itself should be highlighted or
        underlined.
      </p>
      <p>
        For 7 days, you should read this expression out loud 1-2 times. Don't
        make yourself necessarily memorize it, just concentrate on it and try to
        understand what you are really saying. It takes 10 seconds to read a
        phrase twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 7 days of everyday repetition, you should take a one-week break.
        After the break, read the phrase 3 times in 10 seconds. You should do it
        out loud, emotionally and clearly, with full concentration.
      </p>
      <p>2 weeks later, read it out loud again (3 times in 10 seconds).</p>

      <h3>70 + 10 + 10 = 90 seconds.</h3>
      <p>
        This strategy allows you to cement the expression in your memory. All of
        this has been checked by the author of this method.
